# Harjot Josan - CV Website

## Project Analysis

### User Profile
The final users targeted by this project would be professionals, recruiters, and companies interested in learning more about my skills, work experience, and professional capabilities, looking to review my professional background and skill set. The CV page is designed to provide a quick, simple overview of my career journey and technical skills. End users should be able to gain an understanding of my professional expertise and personality, and easily access contact details for collaboration opportunities.

### Information Architecture

This project is based on a single-page static website, where the structure is designed for efficient navigation and quick acces to key information. The layout is basically divided in two columns. The left column is used to display Profile, Contact Information and Social Links. Meanwhile, the right column contains information about professional Experience, Skills and Hobbies.

The Profile section contains a photo and name at the top left, accompanied by a brief self-introduction. Contact Information and Social Links are positioned near the Profile for quick access. 

The Experience section is organized chronologically to showcase work history, with each role and corresponding timeline displayed clearly. 
Skills are shown in a list with visual bars animated using CSS ease effect, indicating skill levels. Lastly, I used the Hobbies section to show my explorer spirit and showcase my non-professional activities, allowing viewers to connect with my interests outside of work. 

The responsive design ensures that all sections are accessible and easy to read across devices.

### Visual Design

The visual design incorporates a modern, clean aesthetic that balances professionalism with simplicity. A palette of green, gray, and white is used to create a modern minimalist look. The primary color is a lite green (`#66cc99`), used as an accent in section titles, links, and skill bars. The gray (`#4a4e51`) and white backgrounds create a clear contrast for readability while separating diferent types of information. 

The fonts used are **Varela Round** for the name title and **Open Sans** for body text. 
Using round image for the profile comes from my actual CV design and a solid circle mimics the frame for the photo. Initially the circle was aligned center of the profile picture, but a misalignement made by accident gives it a niche touch. It's not bug, it's a feature! In addition, the use of emojis give the whole page more interactive vibe, even though there isn't much to interact with. 

To ensure that all elements align correctly, a `clearfix` class is used. This method helps to keep the content sections visually organized and aligned, preventing overlapping or layout shifts. It worksk like wonders.

Page responsivenes wasn't in the initial plan but it was implemented after seeing the page on the laptop that has a diferent resolution from the desktop computer and finding out how easy it was to adjust diferent rules for various screen sizes. This ensures that text remains readable and that interactive elements, like links and buttons, are accessible regardless of the device.
